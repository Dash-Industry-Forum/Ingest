Liason text ingest specification

DASH IF has published a live media ingest specification for community review. 
The aim of this new specification is to improve interoperability between server side entities,
such as live ABR encoders, packager and content delivery networks. It aims to ease 
this well known interoperability bottleneck in the industry. 
It envisions ingest/egress using Common Media Application Track Format (CMAF) using HTTP POST based transmission,
and defines two interfaces for two main use cases. The first, CMAF or fMP4 based ingest can be used for 
example to ingest to active streaming origins and packagers. The second interface implements a push based DASH 
protocol for ingest to a passive origin server and/or content delivery network that need not repackage the content. 
Particular attention was paid to  support of timed metadata, such as SCTE-35 based splice points or program 
information in CMAF based tracks, and redundancy and failover support. The specification is available for 
public feedback up to the 31st of July.
