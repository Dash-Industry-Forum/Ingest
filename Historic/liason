DASH IF published a live media ingest protocol specification for community review. 

The aim of this new specification is to improve interoperability between server side entities,

such as live ABR encoders, packagers and content delivery networks. It aims to ease 

this well known interoperability bottleneck in the industry. 

It envisions ingest/egress using Common Media Application Track Format (CMAF) using HTTP POST based transmission,

and defines two interfaces for two main use cases. The first, CMAF or fMP4 based ingest can be used for 

example to ingest to active streaming origins and packagers, these entities can then do media 
processing of the content. The second interface implements a push based DASH 

protocol for ingest to a passive origin server and/or content delivery network that need not repackage the content. 

Particular attention was paid to  support of timed metadata, such as SCTE-35 based splice points or program 

information in CMAF based tracks, and redundancy and failover support. The specification will help live 

encoders to implement a consistent output format, and downstream entities a consistent input format.  

The specification is available for public feedback up to the 31st of July, and available under 
https://dashif-documents.azurewebsites.net/Ingest/master/DASH-IF-Ingest.html.

We think this specification is of particular interest to MPEG considering 

- interoperability between Media processing entities defined in MPEG Network based media processing 
- Technology under consideration in Common Media Application Track Format (CMAF), in particular the singalling 
  of broadcast related metadata in fmp4 or cmaf track files, DASH-IF spec would benefit from further standardization
  of timed metadata tracks 
- DASH, a push based version of dash introduces some constraints to the manifest and push based protocol operation 
  these modes might be of interest to the DASH group for technologies under consideration.
