	   <th colspan="1">Summary of Change: </th>
       <td colspan="3" bgcolor="LightYellow ">This document specifies the protocol interfaces for live ingest/egress of media content.
	   A well defined protocol interface between live ABR encoder and downstream packager 
       and origin is present, that includes timed metadata, spice information, redundancy and failover support.

<tr>
		<th colspan="1">Consequences if not approved: </th>
        <td colspan="3" bgcolor="LightYellow ">Poor interoperability between live encoder sources, origin servers, content delivery networks. 
	    It will keep live and low latency streaming setups with redundancy and failover support difficult to deploy and maintain in practice. 
        Less interactivity and less programme information will be available in OTT when compared to linear broadcast		</td>
